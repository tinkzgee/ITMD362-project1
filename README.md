# project1
You will create a single-page design that features a sign-up process to get new users to join some type of project, such as an email list, a software beta test, or an open-source community. The goal of this project is to experiment with patterns of interaction that persuade someone to sign up for whatever it is youâ€™re offering, which is not at all an easy task.
